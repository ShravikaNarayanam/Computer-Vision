# Facial Keypoint Recognition 

Deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built to perform facial keypoint detection and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces. YouTube Faces Dataset is used for training facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face! These keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications.
